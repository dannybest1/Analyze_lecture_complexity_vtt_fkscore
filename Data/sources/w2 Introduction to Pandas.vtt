00:00:06.262 --> 00:00:10.695
This week, we're going to deepen our
investigation into how Python can be used

2
00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:15.075
to manipulate, clean, and query data
by looking at the pandas data toolkit.

3
00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:17.951
Pandas was created by
Wes McKinney in 2008.

4
00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:21.476
It is an open source project
under a permissive license.

5
00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:24.657
As an open source project,
it has a strong community,

6
00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:29.586
with more than a 100 software developers
committing code to help make it better.

7
00:00:29.586 --> 00:00:33.960
Now, you should use the tools within
the course to engage with the instructor,

8
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.957
the course assistants, and your peers
in order to get help with pandas.

9
00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:41.905
But I also want to encourage you to go
beyond this, and frankly, you'll probably

10
00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:46.200
have to, and use question and
answering sites such as Stack Overflow.

11
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.211
Stack Overflow is used broadly within
the software development community to post

12
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:54.470
questions about programming, programming
languages, and programming toolkits.

13
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.268
What's special about Stack Overflow
is that it's heavily curated by

14
00:00:58.268 --> 00:00:59.177
the community.

15
00:00:59.177 --> 00:01:03.910
And the pandas community in particular
uses it as their number one resource for

16
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.280
helping new members.

17
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.065
It's quite possible, if you post
a question to Stack Overflow and

18
00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:10.485
tag it as being pandas and

19
00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:14.829
Python related, that the pandas
developer will respond to your question.

20
00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.465
In addition to posting questions,
Stack Overflow is a great

21
00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:22.613
place to see what issues people
are having and how they can be solved.

22
00:01:22.613 --> 00:01:25.328
A second resource you might
want to consider are books.

23
00:01:25.328 --> 00:01:30.316
In 2012, Wes McKinney wrote the definitive
pandas reference book called Python for

24
00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:32.921
Data Analysis, and published by O'Reilly.

25
00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:36.500
And this was updated in
2017 to the second edition.

26
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.504
I consider this the go-to textbook for
the class and

27
00:01:39.504 --> 00:01:42.924
an important resource in
understanding how pandas works.

28
00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:45.525
But I also appreciate the more brief book,

29
00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:48.423
Learning the Pandas Library
by Matt Harrison.

30
00:01:48.423 --> 00:01:51.821
It's not a comprehensive book
on data analysis and statistics.

31
00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:56.202
But if you just want to learn the basics
of pandas and want to do it quickly,

32
00:01:56.202 --> 00:01:58.479
I think it's a well laid out volume.

33
00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.979
The field of data science is rapidly
changing, there's new toolkits and

34
00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.623
methods being created every day.

35
00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.376
It can be tough to stay
on top of all of this.

36
00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:07.637
Marco Rodriguez and

37
00:02:07.637 --> 00:02:12.464
Tim Golden maintain a wonderful blog
aggregator site called Planet Python.

38
00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:16.309
You can visit visit the webpage at
planetpython.org, subscribe with

39
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:20.617
an RSS reader, or get the latest articles
from the Planet Python Twitter feed.

40
00:02:20.617 --> 00:02:24.346
There are lots of regular Python
data science contributors,

41
00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:28.445
and I highly recommend that you
follow it if you're into RSS feeds.

42
00:02:28.445 --> 00:02:33.122
Similarly, if you're into podcasts,
I like Python Bytes by Michael Kennedy and

43
00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:33.951
Brian Okken.

44
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:37.651
Their episodes are short and
more Python news related, and

45
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:42.546
this is a great way to keep up with some
of the activity in the python ecosystem.

46
00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:45.697
All right, here's my last plug
on how to deepen your learning.

47
00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:49.491
Kyle Polich runs an excellent
podcast called Data Skeptic.

48
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:53.070
And while it isn't Python-based per se,
it is well produced and

49
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.649
has a wonderful mixture of interviews
with experts in the field,

50
00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:58.812
as well as short educational lessons.

51
00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:02.754
Much of the work he describes is
specific to machine learning methods and

52
00:03:02.754 --> 00:03:05.220
will serve you well
throughout this degree.

53
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.532
With all of this in hand,

54
00:03:06.532 --> 00:03:11.100
let's jump into learning more about the
Python data manipulation toolkit, pandas.
