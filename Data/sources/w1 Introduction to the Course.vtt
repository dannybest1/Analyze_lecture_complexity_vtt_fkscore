00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.410
Hi. I'm Chris Brooks,

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.910
faculty here at the University of

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.920
Michigan School of Information.

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.590
This class is about
data manipulation,

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.510
and data manipulation is really

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.105
the foundation of what you'll
do as a data scientist.

7
00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:22.470
And that doesn't really change
even as you deepen a lot

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.055
of your investigation and
your skills in the area.

9
00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:28.260
So in this course, we're
going to teach you

10
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.600
the excellent Pandas library.

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.610
It's wonderful for data
manipulation it is

12
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.175
the de facto standard for Python.

13
00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:36.855
When you come out of this class,

14
00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:40.110
you should be quite masterful
on the use of that library.

15
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.230
We're going to teach you
about how to acquire data,

16
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.415
how to clean data,

17
00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:45.680
how to manipulate and
joined data together,

18
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.415
and to make basic inferences
about that data.

19
00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.620
Now we expect that
you already have

20
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.440
some Python skills and
some statistics skills,

21
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.900
but this course is really
a place where you're

22
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.840
going to get to build
those skills through practice.

23
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.130
There'll be some course
resources off to the sidebar in

24
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.365
the course shell that describe

25
00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:10.280
other ways that you can get
some experience with Python.

26
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.680
I filmed the lectures
for this course

27
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.380
in very specific manner.

28
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.440
I'm using a tutorial style,

29
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.990
where most of what you'll be

30
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.970
watching is actually
screen captures

31
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.270
of me typing into
Jupyter Notebooks code.

32
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.990
I'm doing a couple of
unique things with this.

33
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.660
One, you'll see all of my texts,

34
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.120
all my comments in
that code live.

35
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.890
So you'll be able to
read as well as listen.

36
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.890
But I wanted to share with you
a strategy that I think is

37
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.630
powerful for learning and

38
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.910
learning using
the Jupyter Notebooks.

39
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.765
So let's take a look at some
of the core shell right now.

40
00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:51.360
So this is the coursera core
shell here on the left,

41
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.970
and on the right-hand
side I've opened

42
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.160
up the Jupyter Notebooks.

43
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.470
So this is actually a MOOC that I

44
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.250
taught and I'm going
to use to demonstrate.

45
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.355
When you go to a video
on the course,

46
00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:04.410
let's say this one on DataFrames.

47
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.010
You'll see that it's
a regular instructional video,

48
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.210
I'll just mute that.

49
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.520
You can seek around in

50
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.890
the video and there's 
some talking head.

51
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.045
But the majority of it is
going to look like this,

52
00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:19.085
and let's just close the notes
and close the sidebar.

53
00:02:19.085 --> 00:02:21.530
The majority of it's actually
going to look like this.

54
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.630
It's going to be
me working through

55
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.120
examples in a Jupyter Notebook.

56
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.270
And I think the most
powerful way to learn in

57
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.555
this course is actually to
go into your Jupyter system,

58
00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:34.730
so I've got that here
on the right-hand side,

59
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.170
and there'll be a separate video

60
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.335
about the Coursera
Jupyter platform.

61
00:02:39.335 --> 00:02:43.600
But to actually create
a new Python Notebook,

62
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.965
it's empty and maybe name
it after the lecture,

63
00:02:49.965 --> 00:02:53.980
so this was dataframes I think.

64
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.100
And to follow from
the beginning what I'm

65
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.379
doing and type it in yourself,

66
00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.330
so here we'll maybe
seek to the beginning.

67
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.470
So here you can
see I'm looking at

68
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.485
some cricket loving countries
in this example.

69
00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:11.450
So you can just type here,

70
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.885
cricket loving countries, and

71
00:03:14.885 --> 00:03:18.865
just follow
the example as you go.

72
00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.440
The power of doing it
this way is that at

73
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.330
any time you can pause the video,

74
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.545
and you can explore,

75
00:03:24.545 --> 00:03:26.150
and you can start to
look at alternatives,

76
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.340
and you can start
to form questions.

77
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.485
And this is really powerful to be

78
00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:33.050
doing as you're
watching a video to

79
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.465
be actively learning instead of

80
00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.690
just watching
passively this video.

81
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.325
The video has a number of

82
00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:42.920
other opportunities in it,
in particular,

83
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.370
you can increase or decrease
the speed of the video,

84
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.920
and that can be useful
too for review.

85
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.265
I actually think high-speed
video playback is wonderful,

86
00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:55.400
I listen to a lot of
educational video this way,

87
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.020
largely after I've already done

88
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.870
the practice and I've
already experienced at once,

89
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.910
and I just want a quick review
of the content,

90
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.360
I'll flip it on at maybe
one and a half or two

91
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.900
times speed and try and
absorb that content.

92
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.080
The way we've built the videos
for you for this class,

93
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.490
which isn't frankly new to

94
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.170
me and I'd love to
get your feedback

95
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.270
on is with that whole transcript

96
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.560
within the video as well.

97
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.745
So you should be able to read

98
00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:22.880
and listen to the video
at the same time.

99
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.025
We've got a number of
different supports

100
00:04:25.025 --> 00:04:27.110
for you as you're
learning in this course.

101
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.330
We've got office hours,

102
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.390
we've got slack communications,

103
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.105
and we've got
Piazza discussion forums,

104
00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:36.560
and so I'd encourage you to take

105
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.315
advantage of all of these.

106
00:04:38.315 --> 00:04:40.100
I'll be in the office hours or

107
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.885
the instructor of
this course will,

108
00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:43.160
along with other people,

109
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.005
such as graduate students
or staff persons.

110
00:04:48.005 --> 00:04:49.940
And you really can't go wrong with

111
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.430
practicing over and over again.

112
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.220
So please grab
the educational videos

113
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.960
as you're watching them,

114
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.030
engage with a blank notebook,

115
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.455
and just follow along and

116
00:05:00.455 --> 00:05:04.365
see how you've maybe
misinterpreted things,

117
00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:07.940
different investigations
that you've gone off on,

118
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.130
and share what you
found or questions

119
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.830
you have with the rest
of the class.
